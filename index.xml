      <description>is a Miami based web developer and designer.
The things he has seen and felt in his young lifetime have shaped the way he captures the world. With this, he is able to bring a new age perspective to the crowds that identify with “Verde” the brand.
His designs derive from a spirit of expression. He is methodical about the moods and aesthetic of his work. The presence of raw emotion and feeling is an objective for each piece.</description>
